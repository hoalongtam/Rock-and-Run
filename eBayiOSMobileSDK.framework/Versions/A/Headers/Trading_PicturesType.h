 One aspect of the variations that will be illustrated in the 
 pictures for all variations. For example, if each variation 
 is visually distinguished by color and the pictures show 
 the different colors available, then specify "Color" as the name.
 The name must match one of the names specified in the 
 variation specifics.
 Required when variation pictures are present.

/**
 
 One or more pictures that help buyers distinguish the Variations. 
 Multiple picture sets can be specified.
 For example, suppose a listing contains blue and black color 
 variations, and VariationSpecificName=Color. In this case,
 one picture set could contain pictures of the blue shirts 
 (e.g., front view, back view, and close-up of a trim detail), 
 and another picture set could contain pictures of the black shirts.<br>
 <br>
 At least one picture set is required if the Pictures node 
 is present in the request. You are not required to provide pictures 
 for all values that correspond to the variation specific name. 
 For example, a listing could have pictures depicting the blue and 
 black color variations, but not the pink variations.
